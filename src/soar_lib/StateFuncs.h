 * The sOAR Optimal Annual Routine library...
 * <BR />
 * <DIV class="groupHeader">Overview</DIV>
 * The main classes are
 * - Settings containing the input parameters for both Backward and Forward simulation
 * - Backward searching backward in time for each animal state to find the
 *   the optimal state to enter the given state.
 * - StateFuncs defining the functions used for state changing. Some of these functions
 *   use the FuncType class to allow user defined functions
 * - Decision contains the optimal strategy computed by backward
 * - Forward runs the simulation from a starting population forward in time to check the strategy 
 *   using the Settings and Decision computed by Backward.
